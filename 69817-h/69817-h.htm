<p><em>The least distinguished person in ‘Who’s Who’ has
escaped, as it were, from that fashionable crush, and
is spending a quiet evening at home. He is curled
up in his studio, which is so dark that he would be
invisible, had we not obligingly placed his wicker chair
just where the one dim ray from the stove may strike
his face. His eyes are closed luxuriously, and we
could not learn much about him without first poking
our fingers into them. According to the tome mentioned
(to which we must return him before morning),
Mr. Bodie is sixty-three, has exhibited in the Royal
Academy, and is at present unmarried. They do
not proclaim him comparatively obscure: they left
it indeed to him to say the final word on this subject,
and he has hedged. Let us put it in this way, that he
occupies more space in his wicker chair than in the
book, where nevertheless he looks as if it was rather
lonely not to be a genius. He is a painter for the
nicest of reasons, that it is delightful to live and die in
a messy studio; for our part, we too should have
become a painter had it not been that we always lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
our paint-box. There is no spirited bidding to acquire
Mr. Bodie’s canvases: he loves them at first sight
himself, and has often got up in the night to see how
they are faring; but ultimately he has turned cold to
them, and has even been known to offer them, in lieu
of alms, to beggars, who departed cursing. We have
a weakness for persons who don’t get on, and so cannot
help adding, though it is no business of ours, that
Mr. Bodie had private means. Curled up in his
wicker chair he is rather like an elderly cupid. We
wish we could warn him that the policeman is coming.</em></p>

<p><em>The policeman comes: in his hand the weapon
that has knocked down more malefactors than all the
batons—the bull’s-eye. He strikes with it now, right
and left, revealing, as if she had just entered the room,
a replica of the Venus of Milo, taller than himself
though he is stalwart. It is the first meeting of these
two, but, though a man who can come to the boil, he is
as little moved by her as she by him. After the first
glance she continues her reflections. Her smile over
his head vaguely displeases him. For two pins he
would arrest her.</em></p>

<p><em>The lantern finds another object, more worthy of his
attention, the artist. Mr. Bodie is more restive under
the light than was his goddess, perhaps because he is less
accustomed to being stared at. He blinks and sits up.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span> (<em>giving his visitor a lesson in
manners</em>). I beg your pardon, officer.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>confounded</em>). Not that, sir; not
at all.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span> (<em>pressing his advantage</em>). But I
insist on begging your pardon, officer.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> I don’t see what for, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span> (<em>fancying himself</em>). For walking
uninvited into the abode of a law-abiding London
citizen, with whom I have not the pleasure of
being acquainted.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>after thinking this out</em>). But I’m
the one as has done that, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span> (<em>with neat surprise</em>). So you are,
I beg your pardon, officer.</p>

<p>(<em>With pardonable pride in himself</em> <span class="smcap">MR.
BODIE</span> <em>turns on the light. The studio, as
we can now gather from its sloped roof, is
at the top of a house; and its window is
heavily screened, otherwise we might see
the searchlights through it, showing that we
are in the period of the great war. Though
no one speaks of</em> <span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE’S</span> <em>pictures as
Bodies, which is the true test of fame, he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
sufficiently eminent not to have works of
art painted or scratched on his walls, mercy
has been shown even to the panels of his
door, and he is handsomely stingy of draperies.
The Venus stands so prominent
that the studio is evidently hers rather than
his. The stove has been brought forward
so that he can rest his feet on it, which ever
of his easy chairs he is sitting in, and he
also falls over it at times when stepping back
to consider his latest failure. On a shelf is
a large stuffed penguin, which is to be one
of the characters in the play, and on each
side of this shelf are two or three tattered
magazines. We had hankered after giving</em>
<span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span> <em>many rows of books, but were
well aware that he would get only blocks of
wood so cleverly painted to look like books
that they would deceive everyone except the
audience. Everything may be real on the
stage except the books. So there are only
a few magazines in the studio (and very
likely when the curtain rings up it will be
found that they are painted too). But</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span> <em>was a reader; he had books in
another room, and the careworn actor must
suggest this by his manner.</em></p>

<p><em>Our</em> <span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> <em>is no bookman; we who
write happen to have it from himself that he
had not bought a book since he squeezed
through the sixth standard: very tight was
his waist that day, he told us, and he had to
let out every button. Nevertheless it was
literature of a sort that first brought him into
our ken. He was our local constable: and
common interests, as in the vagaries of the
moon, gradually made him and us cease to
look at each other askance. We fell into the
way of chatting with him and giving him
the evening papers we had bought to read as
we crossed the streets. One of his duties
was to herd the vagrant populace under our
arches during air-raids, and at such times
he could be properly gruff, yet comforting,
like one who would at once run in any bomb
that fell in his beat. When he had all his
flock nicely plastered against the dank walls
he would occasionally come to rest beside us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and thaw, and discuss the newspaper
article that had interested him most. It
was seldom a war-record; more frequently
it was something on the magazine page, such
as a symposium by the learned on ‘Do you
Believe in Love at First Sight?’ Though
reticent in many matters he would face this
problem openly; with the guns cracking all
around, he would ask for our views wistfully;
he spoke of love without a blush, as something
recognised officially at Scotland Yard.
At this time he had been in love, to his own
knowledge, for several weeks, but whether
the god had struck him at first sight he was
not certain; he was most anxious to know,
and it was in the hope of our being able to
help him out that he told us his singular
story. On his face at such times was often
an amazed look, as if he were staring at her
rather than at us, and seeing a creature
almost beyond belief. Our greatest success
was in saying that perhaps she had fallen
in love at first sight with him, which on
reflection nearly doubled him up. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
insisted on knowing what had made us put
forward this extraordinary suggestion; he
would indeed scarcely leave our company
that night, and discussed the possibility with
us very much as if it were a police case.</em></p>

<p><em>Our policeman’s romance, now to be told,
began, as we begin, with his climbing up
into</em> <span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE’S</span> <em>studio</em>. <span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span> <em>having
turned on the light gave him the nasty
look that means ‘And now, my man, what
can I do for you?’ Our</em> <span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span>, <em>however,
was not one to be worsted without
striking a blow. He strode to the door, as
he has told us, and pointed to a light <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note—Original text: in the passage." id="tn-7">in
the passage.</ins></em>)</p>


<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>in his most brow-beating voice, so
well known under the arches</em>). Look here, sir,
it’s that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE.</span> I don’t follow.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Look at that passage window.
(<em>With natural pride in language.</em>) You are
showing too much illumination.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Oh! well, surely—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>with professional firmness</em>). It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
agin the regulations. A party in the neighbouring
skylight complains.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>putting out the light</em>). If that
will do for to-night, I’ll have the window
boarded up.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Anything so long as it obscures
the illumination.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>irritated</em>). Shuts out the light.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>determinedly</em>). Obscures the illumination.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>on reflection</em>). I remember now, I did
have that window boarded up.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>who has himself a pretty vein of
sarcasm</em>). I don’t see the boards.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Nor do I see the boards. (<em>Pondering.</em>)
Can she have boned them?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> She? (<em>He is at once aware that
it has become a more difficult case.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> You are right. She is scrupulously
honest, and if she took the boards we may be
sure that I said she could have them. But that
only adds to the mystery.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>obligingly</em>). Mystery?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Why this passion for collecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
boards? Try her with a large board, officer.
Extraordinary!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>heavily</em>). I don’t know what you
are talking about, sir. Are you complaining of
some woman?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Now that is the question. Am I?
As you are here, officer, there is something I
want to say to you. But I should dislike getting
her into trouble.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>stoutly</em>). No man what is a man
wants to get a woman into trouble unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>much struck</em>). That’s true! That’s
absolutely true, officer.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>badgered</em>). It’s true, but there’s
nothing remarkable about it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Excuse me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> See here, sir, I’m just an
ordinary policeman.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I can’t let that pass. If I may say
so, you have impressed me most deeply. I
wonder if I might ask a favour of you. Would
you mind taking off your helmet? As it happens,
I have never seen a policeman without
his helmet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<em>The perplexed officer puts his helmet on

</div>

<p>Thank you. (<em>Studying the effect.</em>) Of course
I knew they took off. You sit also?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<em>The policeman sits.</em>)</p>
</div>

<p>Very interesting.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> About this woman, sir—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> We are coming to her. Perhaps I
ought to tell you my name—Mr. Bodie. (<em>Indicating
the Venus.</em>) This is Mrs. Bodie. No,
I am not married. It is merely a name given
her because she is my ideal.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> You gave me a turn.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Now that I think of it, I believe the
name was given to her by the very woman we

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>producing his note book</em>). To
begin with, who is the woman we are talking
about?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>becoming more serious</em>). On the surface,
she is just a little drudge. These studios
are looked after by a housekeeper, who employs
this girl to do the work.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> H’m! Sleeps on the premises?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> No; she is here from eight to six.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Place of abode?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> She won’t tell anyone that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Aha! What’s the party’s
name?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Cinderella.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<em>The</em> <span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> <em>writes it down unmoved</em>.
<span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span> <em>twinkles</em>.)</p>
</div>

<p>Haven’t you heard that name before?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Can’t say I have, sir. But I’ll
make inquiries at the Yard.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> It was really I who gave her that
name, because she seemed such a poor little
neglected waif. After the girl in the story-book,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> No, sir, I don’t know. In the
Force we find it impossible to keep up with
current fiction.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> She was a girl with a broom. There
must have been more in the story than that, but
I forget the rest.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> The point is, that’s not the
name she calls herself by.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Yes, indeed it is. I think she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
called something else when she came, Miss
Thing, or some such name; but she took to the
name of Cinderella with avidity, and now she
absolutely denies that she ever had any
other.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Parentage?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>now interested in his tale</em>). That’s
another odd thing. I seem to remember vaguely
her telling me that her parents when alive were
very humble persons indeed. Touch of Scotch
about her, I should say—perhaps from some
distant ancestor; but Scotch words and phrases
still stick to the Cockney child like bits of egg-shell
to a chicken.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>writing</em>). Egg-shell to chicken.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I find, however, that she has lately
been telling the housekeeper quite a different
story.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>like a counsel</em>). Proceed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> According to this, her people were of
considerable position—a Baron and Baroness,
in fact.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Proceed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> The only other relatives she seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
to have mentioned are two sisters of unprepossessing
appearance.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>cleverly</em>). If this story is correct,
what is she doing here?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I understand there is something
about her father having married again, and her
being badly treated. She doesn’t expect this
to last. It seems that she has reason to believe
that some very remarkable change may take
place in her circumstances at an early date, at
a ball for which her godmother is to get her
what she calls an invite. This is evidently to
be a very swagger function at which something
momentous is to occur, the culminating moment
being at midnight.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>writing</em>). Godmother. Invite.
Twelve <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Fishy! Tell me about them
boards now.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>who is evidently fond of the child</em>). You
can’t think how wistful she is to get hold of
boards. She has them on the brain. Carries
them off herself into the unknown.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> I daresay she breaks them up
for firewood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> No; she makes them into large boxes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>sagaciously</em>). Very likely to keep
things in.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> She has admitted that she keeps
things in them. But what things? Ask her
that, and her mouth shuts like a trap.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Any suspicions?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span> <em>hesitates. It seems absurd to
suspect this waif—and yet!</em>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I’m sorry to say I have. I don’t
know what the things are, but I do know they
are connected in some way with Germany.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>darkly</em>). Proceed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>really troubled</em>). Officer, she is too
curious about Germany.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> That’s bad.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> She plies me with questions about it—not
openly—very cunningly.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Such as—?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> For instance, what would be the
punishment for an English person caught hiding
aliens in this country?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> If she’s up to games of that
kind—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Does that shed any light on the boxes,
do you think?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> She can’t keep them shut up in
boxes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I don’t know. She is extraordinarily
dogged. She knows a number of German words.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> That’s ugly.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> She asked me lately how one could
send a letter to Germany without Lord Haig
knowing. By the way, do you, by any chance,
know anything against a firm of dressmakers
called <i lang="fr">Celeste et Cie.</i>?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Celest A. C.? No, but it has
a German sound.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> It’s French.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Might be a blind.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I think she lives at Celeste’s. Now
I looked up <span lang="fr">Celeste et Cie</span>. in the telephone book,
and I find they are in Bond Street. Immensely
fashionable.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> She lives in Bond Street? London’s
full of romance, sir, to them as knows
where to look for it—namely, the police. Is she
on the premises?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>reluctantly</em>). Sure to be; it isn’t six yet.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>in his most terrible voice</em>). Well,
leave her to me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> You mustn’t frighten her. I can’t
help liking her. She’s so extraordinarily
<em>homely</em> that you can’t be with her many minutes
before you begin thinking of your early
days. Where were you born, officer?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> I’m from Badgery.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> She’ll make you think of Badgery.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>frowning</em>). She had best try no
games on me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> She will have difficulty in answering
questions; she is so used to asking them. I
never knew a child with such an appetite for
information. She doesn’t search for it in books;
indeed the only book of mine I can remember
ever seeing her read, was a volume of fairy tales.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>stupidly</em>). Well, that don’t help
us much. What kind of questions?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Every kind. What is the Censor?
Who is Lord <em>Times</em>?—she has heard people here
talking of that paper and its proprietor, and has
mixed them up in the quaintest way; then again—when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
a tailor measures a gentleman’s legs
what does he mean when he says—26, 4—32, 11?
What are doctors up to when they tell you to
say 99? In finance she has an almost morbid
interest in the penny.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> The penny? It’s plain the
first thing to find out is whether she’s the slavey
she seems to be, or a swell in disguise.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> You won’t find it so easy.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Excuse me, sir; we have an
infall<em>ay</em>ble way at Scotland Yard of finding out
whether a woman is common or a lady.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>irritated</em>). An infallible way.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>firmly</em>). Infallayable.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I should like to know what it is.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> There is nothing against my
telling you. (<em>He settles down to a masterly cross-examination.</em>)
Where, sir, does a common
female keep her valuables when she carries
them about on her person?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> In her pocket, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> And you suppose correctly.
But where does a lady keep them?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> In the same place, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Then you suppose wrongly. No,
sir, here. (<em>He taps his own chest, and indicates
discreetly how a lady may pop something down
out of sight.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>impressed</em>). I believe you are right,
officer.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> I am right—it’s infallayble.
A lady, what with drink and such like misfortunes,
may forget all her other refinements, but
she never forgets that. At the Yard it’s considered
as sure as finger-marks.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Strange! I wonder who was the
first woman to do it. It couldn’t have been
Eve this time, officer.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>after reflecting</em>). I see your point.
And now I want just to have a look at the party
unbeknownst to her. Where could I conceal
myself?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Hide?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Conceal myself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> That small door opens on to my
pantry, where she washes up.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>peeping in</em>). It will do. Now
bring her up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> It doesn’t seem fair—I really can’t—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> War-time, sir.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span> <em>decides that it is patriotic to

<p>These belong to the party, sir?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I forgot. She keeps them in there.

Gaudy feathers. And yet that hat may have

you and I are not at this moment on rather holy

owing to her desire to give satisfaction.</em>)</p>

<p><em>Our</em> <span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span>, <em>as he has told us under
the arches, was watching her through the
keyhole, but his first impressions have been
so coloured by subsequent events that it is
questionable whether they would be accepted
in any court of law. Is prepared to depose
that to the best of his recollection, they were
unfavourable. Does not imply by unfavourable
any aspersion on her personal
appearance. Would accept the phrase ‘far
from striking’ as summing up her first
appearance. Would no longer accept the
phrase. Had put her down as being a
grown woman, but not sufficiently grown.
Thought her hair looked to be run up her
finger. Did not like this way of doing the
hair. Could not honestly say that she
seemed even then to be an ordinary slavey
of the areas. She was dressed as one, but
was suspiciously clean. On the other hand,
she had the genuine hungry look. Among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
more disquieting features noticed a sort of
refinement in her voice and manner, which
was characteristic of the criminal classes.
Knew now that this was caused by the
reading of fairy tales and the thinking of
noble thoughts. Noted speedily that she
was a domineering character who talked
sixteen to the dozen, and at such times reminded
him of funny old ladies. Was
much struck by her eyes, which seemed to
suggest that she was all burning inside.
This impression was strengthened later
when he touched her hands. Felt at once
the curious ‘homeliness’ of her, as commented
on by</em> <span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span>, <em>but could swear
on oath that this had not at once made him
think of Badgery. Could recall not the
slightest symptoms of love at first sight.
On the contrary, listened carefully to the
conversation between her and</em> <span class="smcap">Mr. Bodie</span>
<em>and formed a stern conclusion about her.
Believed that this was all he could say
about his first impression.</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>breathlessly</em>). Did you rang, sir?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>ashamed</em>). Did I? I did—but—I—I

you ought to know why.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> What is it about the woman?</p>

She is the glory of glories.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>who would be willowy if she were

All women long to be like her, but none ever
can be.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>insisting</em>). I suppose that’s the
reason she has that snigger on her face.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> That is perhaps the smile of motherhood.
Some people think there was once a baby
in her arms.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>with a new interest in Venus</em>).
Her own?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I suppose so.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> A married woman then?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>nonplussed</em>). Don’t ask trivial questions.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>generously</em>). It was clever of

Some other artist chappie did it. (<em>He

more than a thousand years.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> And the baby gone?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>snapping</em>). Yes.</p>

have been found with that pleased look on my
face, not in a thousand years.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Her arms were broken, you see, so
she had to drop the baby—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> She could have up with her
knee and catched it—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>excitedly</em>). By heavens, that may just

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Why is it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I suppose he is very difficult to satisfy.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>knitting her lips</em>). He has never

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Cinderella, your pulse is galloping.

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>stung</em>). So is everybody (<em>pathetically</em>).
I’ve tried. But it’s none so easy,

You’ll see where the su-perb shoulders and the

small feet.</p>

forward steps the Lord Mayor, and, <em>utterly disregarding
her uppers</em>, he points to the bottom of
her skirt, and he says ‘Lift!’ and she <em>has</em> to
lift, and there’s a dead silence, and nothing to
be heard except the Prince crying ‘Throw her
out!’</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>somewhat staggered by her knowledge

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I must forbid....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>with dreadful resolution</em>). I’m
ready. I wants to know myself.</p>

you say that the old party downstairs had paid
you your wages to-day.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I see nothing you can prove
by that. It was a half-week’s wages—1s. 7d.
Of course I could see my way clearer if it had
been 1s. 9d.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> That’s neither here nor there.
We’ll proceed. Now, very likely you wrapped
the money up in a screw of paper. Did you?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I did.</p>

feet and is glorified. She slips off her shoe

<p><em>It is later in the evening of the same day, and this

carpet that has been beaten into nothingness, but is still
a carpet, there is a hearth rug of brilliant rags that is
probably gratified when your toes catch in it and you
are hurled against the wall. Two pictures—one of
them partly framed—strike a patriotic note, but they
may be there purposely to deceive. The room is lit
by a lamp, and at first sight presents no sinister aspect
unless it comes from four boxes nailed against the walls
some five or six feet from the floor. In appearance
they are not dissimilar to large grocery boxes, but

could, but it had to be some night—and this is
the night.</p>

me. That’s what you’re called at royal balls.
Then loud huzzas is heard outside from the

When I look about me and see just four boxes I
am a kind of shamed, but it wasn’t very convenient

pointing, and otherwise behaving badly,
eating oranges out of paper bags, then
blowing out the bags and bursting them.
The superb scene is lit by four street lamps
with red glass. Dancing is going on: the
ladies all in white, the gentlemen in black
with swords. If you were unused to royal
balls you would think every one of these
people was worth describing separately;
but, compared to what is coming, it may be
said that</em> <span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> <em>has merely pushed
them on with her lovely foot. They are her
idea of courtiers, and have anxious expressions
as if they knew she was watching them.
They have character in the lump, if we may
put it that way, but none individually.
Thus one cannot smile or sigh, for instance,
without all the others smiling or sighing. At
night they probably sleep in two large beds,
one for ladies and one for gentlemen, and if
one of the ladies, say, wants to turn round,
she gives the signal, and they all turn simultaneously.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
As children they were not like
this; they had genuine personal traits, but
these have gradually been blotted out as they
basked in royal favour; thus, if the</em> <span class="allsmcap">KING</span>
<em>wipes his glasses they all pretend that their
glasses need wiping, and when the</em> <span class="allsmcap">QUEEN</span>
<em>lets her handkerchief fall they all stoop
loyally to pick up their own</em>.</p>

<p><em>The retreat in which</em> <span class="smcap">Cinderella</span> <em>is to be found two
months later has been described to us by our policeman
with becoming awe. It seems to be a very pleasant
house near the sea, and possibly in pre-war days
people were at ease in it. None of that, says the
policeman emphatically, with</em> <span class="allsmcap">DR. BODIE</span> <em>in charge.
He could wink discreetly at</em> <span class="allsmcap">DR. BODIE</span> <em>in absence, but
was prepared to say on oath that no one ever winked
at her when she was present. In the old days he had
been more than a passive observer of the suffragette in
action, had even been bitten by them in the way of
business; had not then gone into the question of their
suitability for the vote, but liked the pluck of them;
had no objection to his feelings on the woman movement
being summed up in this way, that he had vaguely
disapproved of their object, but had admired their
methods. After knowing</em> <span class="allsmcap">DR. BODIE</span> <em>he must admit
that his views about their object had undergone a
change; was now a whole-hearted supporter, felt in
his bones that</em> <span class="allsmcap">DR. BODIE</span> <em>was born to command:
astonishing thing about her that she did it so natural-like.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
She was not in the least mannish or bullying;
she was a very ladylike sort of person, a bit careful
about the doing of her hair, and the set of her hat,
and she had a soft voice, though what you might call
an arbitrary manner. Very noticeable the way she
fixed you with her steely eye. In appearance she was
very like her room at the retreat, or the room was very
like her; everything in cruel good order, as you might
say; an extraordinarily decorous writing table near
the centre, the sort of table against which you instinctively
stood and waited to make your deposition;
the friendliest thing in the room (to a policeman) was
the book-cases with wire doors, because the books
looked through the wires at you in a homely way like
prisoners. It was a sunny room at times, but this did
not take away from its likeness to the doctor, who could
also smile on occasion.</em></p>

<p><em>Into this room</em> <span class="allsmcap">MR. BODIE</span> <em>is shown on a summer
afternoon by a maid with no nonsense about her in

<p><span class="allsmcap">DR. BODIE.</span> She doesn’t know much about
them herself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> No, and we needn’t tell her this.
Her mother—ah well, poor soul!—and the father
was a very bad egg. And from that soil, Nellie,
this flower has sprung. Nobody to tend it.

<p><span class="allsmcap">DR. BODIE</span> (<em>without moving a muscle</em>). I shall
report you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>when the martinet and Danny have gone</em>).
Are you afraid of her, Cinderella? I am.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> No! She sometimes dashes
me, but she is a fearful kind lady. (<em>She pulls
him down again for further important revelations.</em>)
She’s very particular about her feet.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>staggered</em>). Is she! In a feminine
way?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Hurray! Then I have her. The
Achilles Heel! (<em>He is once more jerked down.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I have a spring bed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>in some awe</em>). The first time I
woke in hospital, an angel with streamers was
standing there holding a tray in her hand, and
on the tray was a boiled egg. Then I thought
it was the egg you get the day before you
die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> What egg is that?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>who in the course of a troubled life
has acquired much miscellaneous information</em>).
In the Workhouse you always get an egg to your
tea the day before you die. (<em>She whispers.</em>) I
know now I’m not the real Cinderella.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE</span> (<em>taking her hand</em>). How did you find
out?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>gravely</em>). It’s come to me. The
more I eat the clearer I see things. I think
it was just an idea of mine; being lonely-like I
needed to have something to hang on to.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> That was it. Are you sorry you’re
not the other one?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I’m glad to be just myself.
It’s a pity though about the glass slippers.
That’s a lovely idea.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> Tell me about <em>Them</em>.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> The children? They’re still with
me, of course. I’m keeping my promise, and
they will be with me till you are able to take care
of them again. I have them a great deal in
the studio in the day-time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> Oh, they don’t disturb me much.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I was meaning perhaps the
smell of the paint would be bad for them.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BODIE.</span> I see! Of course I could give up

little detestable?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> Oh no, oh no, no, no, no! But
I’ll tell you one thing as is in it. This—‘There
are thirty-four policemen sitting in this room,
but I would rather have you, my dear.’ What
do you think? That’s a fine bit at the end.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">PROBATIONER</span> (<em>sparkling</em>). Lovely! Go on,
Cinderella, fling reticence to the winds.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>doing so</em>). Unless I am—very
far out—in my judgment of men—that man is
infatuate about me!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">PROBATIONER</span> (<em>clapping her hands</em>). The delicious
scoundrel! Cinderella, be merciless to
him! Knife him, you dear! Give him beans!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>gurgling</em>). I ill-treats him most
terrible!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">PROBATIONER.</span> That’s the way! down with
lovers, slit them to ribbons, stamp on them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> Sometimes I—(<em>she sits up</em>).
Listen!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">PROBATIONER</span> (<em>alarmed</em>). It isn’t Dr. Bodie,
is it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> No, it’s <em>him</em>.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">PROBATIONER.</span> I don’t hear a sound.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I can hear him fanning his
face with his helmet. He has come in such a
hurry. Nurse, you watch me being cruel to
him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">PROBATIONER.</span> At him, Cinderella, at him!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DANNY</span> (<em>flinging open the door</em>). The Constabulary’s

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>without looking round</em>). I thought
it had a visitor’s sound. (<em>She peeps at the</em> <span class="allsmcap">PROBATIONER</span>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>very wooden</em>). You don’t ask who

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>after reflection</em>). I’m here again,
Jane.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>admitting it with a glance</em>).
Perhaps you didn’t ought to come so often; it
puts them about.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>cleverly</em>). But does it put you
about, Jane?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> Hey! Hey! (<em>With a cunning

<p><span class="allsmcap">DANNY</span> (<em>who is not so easily got rid of</em>). You

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> That remains to be seen. (<em>He
stands staring at his divinity.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>sneering</em>). What are you looking
at?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Just at you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>in high delight</em>). Me! There’s
little to look at in me. You should see the larder
at the Home! You’ll have a cup of China tea
and some of this cake?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> No, Jane, no. (<em>In a somewhat
melancholy voice.</em>) Things to eat have very
little interest to me now.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> Oh?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> I’ve gone completely off my

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Did you get my letter, Jane?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>calmly</em>). I got it—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Did you—did you think it was
a peculiar sort of a letter?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>mercilessly</em>). I don’t mind nothing
peculiar in it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> There was no word in it that
took you aback, was there?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> Not that I mind of.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>worried</em>). Maybe you didn’t read
it very careful?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I may have missed something.
What was the word, David?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>in gloom</em>). Oh, it was just a small
affair. It was just a beginning. I thought, if
she stands that she’ll stand more. But if you
never noticed it—(<em>He sighs profoundly.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I’ll take another look—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>brightening</em>). You’ve kept it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I have it here.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> I could let you see the word if
it’s convenient to you to get the letter out of
your pocket.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> It’s not in my pocket.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Is it under the pillow?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>puzzled</em>). Where, then?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span>, <em>with charming modesty, takes
the letter from her bodice. Her lover is
thunderstruck.</em>)</p>
</div>

<p>What made you think of keeping it there?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I didn’t think, David; it just
came to me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>elate</em>). It’s infall<em>ay</em>able! I’ll let
you see the word.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>smiling at the ridiculous man</em>).
You don’t need to bother, David. Fine I know
what the word is.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>anxious</em>). And you like it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> If you like it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> That emboldens me tremendous.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I don’t like that so much. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
there’s one thing I like more than any other
thing in the world—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>eager</em>). Yes?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> It’s seeing you, David, tremendous
bold before all other folk, and just in a
quake before me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>astounded</em>). It’s what I am!
And yet there’s something bold I must say to
you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>faltering genteelly</em>). Is there?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> It’ll be a staggering surprise to
you.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> <em>giggles discreetly</em>.)</p>
</div>

<p>I promised the Doctor as I came in not to
tire you. (<em>With some awe.</em>) She’s a powerful
woman that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> If you tire me I’ll hold up my
hand just like you do to stop the traffic. Go on,
David. Just wait a moment. (<em>She takes off his
helmet and holds it to her thin breast.</em>) Here’s
a friend of mine. Now?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>despairing of himself</em>). I wish I
was a man in a book. It’s pretty the way they
say it; and if ever there was a woman that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
deserved to have it said pretty to her it’s you.
I’ve been reading the books. There was one
chap that could speak six languages. Jane, I
wish I could say it to you in six languages, one
down and another come up, till you had to take
me in the end.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> To take you?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>in woe</em>). Now I’ve gone and said
it in the poorest, silliest way! Did you hold
up your hand to stop me, Jane?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>encouraged</em>). But I’ve said it.
Will you, Jane?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>doggedly</em>). Will I what?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Do you not see what I’m driving
at?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> Fine I see what you’re driving
at.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Then won’t you help me
out?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> If you could just give me a shove.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>sympathetically</em>). Try Badgery.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>brightening</em>). Have you forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
that pool in Badgery Water where the
half-pounder used—No, you never was there!
Jane, the heart of me is crying out to walk with
you by Badgery Water.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> That’s better!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> I would never think of comparing
Mrs. Bodie to you. For my part I think
nothing of uppers. Feet for me.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<em>She gives him her hand to hold.</em>)</p>
</div>

<p>My dear!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> You said <em>that</em> was only a
beginning!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> My dearest!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>glistening</em>). I’m not feeling
none tired, David.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> My pretty!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> I don’t set up to be a prince,
Jane; but I love you in a princely way, and if
you would marry me, you wonder, I’ll be a true
man to you till death us do part. Come on,
Cinders. (<em>Pause.</em>) It’s the only chance that
belt of mine has.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> No, no, I haven’t took you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
yet! There’s a thing you could do for me, that
would gratify me tremendous.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> It’s done.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I want you to let me have the
satisfaction, David, of having refused you once.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Willingly; but what for?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> I couldn’t say. Just because
I’m a woman. Mind you, I daresay I’ll cast
it up at you in the future.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> I’ll risk that. Will you be my
princess, Jane?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> You promise to ask again?
At once?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> Say—I do.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>firmly</em>). It’s a honour you do
me, policeman, to which I am not distasteful.
But I don’t care for you in that way, so let there
be no more on the subject. (<em>Anxiously.</em>) Quick,
David!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> For the second time, will you
marry me, Jane?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>who has been thinking out the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
answer for several days</em>). David, I love thee,
even as the stars shining on the parched earth,
even as the flowers opening their petals to the
sun; even as mighty ocean with its billows;
even so do I love thee, David. (<em>She nestles her
head on his shoulder.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> If only I could have said it like
that!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>happily</em>). That’s just a bit I
was keeping handy. (<em>Almost in a whisper.</em>)
David, do you think I could have a engagement
ring?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>squaring his shoulders</em>). As to
that, Jane, first tell me frankly, do you think
the Police Force is romantical?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> They’re brave and strong,
but—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> The general verdict is no. And
yet a more romantical body of men do not exist.
I have been brooding over this question of engagement
rings, and I consider them unromantical
affairs! (<em>He walks toward his parcel.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> David, what’s in that parcel?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> Humbly hoping you would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
me, Jane, I have had something special made for
you—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> (<em>thrilling</em>). Oh, David, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> It’s a policeman’s idea of an
engagement ring—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> Quick! Quick!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN.</span> —for my amazing romantical
mind said to me that, instead of popping a ring
on the finger of his dear, a true lover should pop
a pair of glass slippers upon her darling feet!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> David, you’re a poet!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">POLICEMAN</span> (<em>not denying it</em>). It’s what you’ve
made me—and proud I would be if, for the honour
of the Force, I set this new fashion in engagement
rings. (<em>He reveals the glass slippers.</em>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA</span> <em>holds out her hands for the

</div>

<p>They’re not for hands. (<em>He uncovers her
feet.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> They’re terrible small! Maybe
they’ll not go on!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="allsmcap">CINDERELLA.</span> No, David, no,—kisses.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
